%% _Part(ab)_
%
% - As it can be seen in all the images above, Lloyd Max quantization does
% better than uniform quantization in general. This is expected, because
% llyod considers the probability distribution of each pixel points and
% quantize the points based on that distrubution. Basically, if we see the
% histograms of these images, there are some parts which are densely
% populated, so for these parts llyod assigns more quantization levels, and
% for the less dense areas we don't see steps that closer to each other.
% This makes a use difference and help with the MSE as it can be seen from
% the MSE plots. This is actually very avidant in testpattern and astronut
% pictures and mse plots. 
% - Looking at the historgram of vase and it's MSE, we
% can see that the hist is more uniformly distributed compared to
% testpattern, and therefore, uniform or llyod are not much different.
% While the mse plots of other two has some kind of spike where we have the
% uneven distribution in the histogram. And since uniform doesn't take
% these densly populated area into consideration, it had the highest mse 
% difference compare to llyod in those regions. 
% 
% 
% Looking at techinical terms, we satisdfy noth nearest neighbor and
% centroid conditions in llyod, while only the centroid in uniform
% quantization. 
% 


%% __Part(c)__
%
% - We see that for the testpattern image, from bit-2 to bit-3 the mse 
% increases for the uniform quantizer. This is probably because of the for
% bit-2 the quantization levels were probably closer to the dense
% areas/spike areas, while futher in the other one, leading to increased
% mse for the latter. 
%
% - Although we don't see Lloyd quantizer getting worse for increasing bit
% rate, it might happen where there is an increase in mse. Let us say, 
% the tie breaking rule for the boundary points, was decided such that it 
% didn't work in the favor of those 'dense/spike' areas. We might still
% converge but it might not be the best. Also, some initial assumptions
% could turn up these results.
