This allows for the plot to have x-axis going from 0 to 255, which are the pixel intensity and y-axis shown from 0 to 1 due to the normalization above and the plot has the increasing curve which represents the CDF (cummulative distribution function) of the histogram of the gray img.</li><li>With the imshow command the image being shown is showing the remapped pixels using the remapping function that is CDF of the image. The map input in imshow has an array of 3 map input because of the matlab colormap convention that takes in one value input for each RGB values. So basically each row of map is a three-element RGB triplet that specifies the red, green, and blue components of a single color of the colormap.</li></ul></div><h2 id="4"><i>Part(b)</i></h2><pre class="codeinput">figure, plot(y,map), <span class="comment">%title('CDF part a');</span>

Thus if we just "ignore" those dark pixels aka the count of pixel 0 is 0, it will help a lot to see the smaller detailed in the image. This basically means we change our n variable's first entry to zero. So using the CDF of this n, we will be able to generate new map and plot the new image.</li><li>As it can be seen from the equalized images, in the new image we are able to see the details of the image clearly, which was not really visible due to the dark background from the first mapping.

</pre><div><ul><li>The 1x3 filter does better (in terms of MSE) than 3x3 filter for babyS. The median filter in general is good for removing salt and pepper noise. Salt noise as we know it, is random white pixels (white dots in an image), which in our case is distributed like vertical streaks in babyS. Here what 1x3 median filter does is, it takes the 3 values in the neighborhood (within that row) and sorts them, chooses the median and assigns it to the pixel of interest. This forces pixels with distinct intensities to be more like it's neighbours. This 1x3 works better than 3x3, because, the former sorts all 9 values (includes 3 rows), potentialy having more noise, since our noise is distributed vertically, making it more error prone than just looking at the row, which 1x3 does well.</li><li>The 3x3 filter does better (in terms of MSE) than 1x3 filter for baby2. Notice that baby2 has added low level of Gaussian noise on top of the salt noise we saw in babyS. Thus even though 1x3 does better for babyS, it doesn't do that well for baby2 due to this added Gaussian noise. Here, 3x3 filter helps because of the low level of Gaussian noise, it will look at the entire neighbourhood and choose the median which will remove all the low extream as well as high and actually chooses the value in the sequence, rather than random number like mean filter could give, that might not even be part of the sequence.</li></ul></div><h2 id="9"><i>Part(b)</i></h2><pre class="codeinput">MF_baby2 = medfilt2(baby2,[3 3]);

</pre><div><ul><li>Here, the sequential use of a median filter and a spatial averaging filter on the baby2 image that has both noise type works better than either of the median filters in part a. However, it is not a significant difference (just ~0.91 mse) from the lowest in part a.</li><li>We see that using the 1x3 is better than 3x3 median filter in this sequence, it is because of the same reason as mentioned in part a. We have vertical salt noise and hence 1x3 is better. So with first operation in the series, we are decreasing that salt noise. Once we get rid of most of the salt noise, we can say that we are somewhat only left with the Gaussian noise.</li><li>Now, because averaging works better with removing gaussian noise, we have better results than just using 3x3 median filter alone for the gaussian noise. Spatial average filter will replace each pixel with the average of it's all neighbours, this will help with the smoothing of the image.</li><li>One thing to note here is that, I tried varies spatial averaging filter, but the only one that actually recudes the error is the strong center weighted averaging filter, rather, the others don't give much different results that part a. This might be because we have the low frequency gaussian noise, and this the strong center helps with keeping the avg close to the pixel of interest and not skew towards the smaller outliers.</li></ul></div><h2 id="11">Problem 3 Unsharp Masking</h2><h2 id="12"><i>Part(a)</i></h2><pre class="codeinput">clc; clear; close <span class="string">all</span>;

Because orignal signal is just the summation of HPF and LPF</li><li>Mask D is the unsharp mask, which is the HPF added to the orignal signal with some positive weight multiplied to it.</li><li>This function performs edge sharpening by taking in the orignal image and lowpass filter image and finds the highpass filter mask to be added to the original image. By defination, the edge sharpened image is generated by adding the high frequency mask to the original image. What high frequency mask means the pixel values that changes quickly, and this happens on the edge of objects in an image. Thus, adding a weighted highpass filter mask, just "bolds" the borders or the edges of the image. Hence, this function performs edge sharpening by just adding the high frequency content to the input image.</li></ul></div><h2 id="15"><i>Part(b)</i></h2><pre class="codeinput">tst = ones(128,1)*[64*ones(1,32) (64:4:188) 192*ones(1,32) 64*ones(1,32)];

It is pretty much similar code as previous part. Here, I used different boost values ranging from 1 to around 30 and some of the results are shown above. What I noticed from the different boost values is that the original blurry moon image gets better as we increase the boost value, i.e, the blurryness decreases and the details are being visible. However, after certain threshold, the image starts to become too sharp for us to see much of the moon and it's just becomes some black and white image. The range that works best is of boostvalues between 8/10 to 20.</p><h2 id="23">Problem 4 Order of Operations</h2><h2 id="24"><i>Part a</i></h2><p>Out of the 6 systems given, 2 pairs will have the same results.</p><div><ol><li>System B: CS --&gt; MF --&gt; SA and System D:  MF --&gt; CS --&gt; SA</li><li>System C: SA --&gt; CS --&gt; MF and System E:  SA --&gt; MF --&gt; CS</li></ol></div><p>Here, Contrast Manipulation (CS), Spatial averaging (SA) and Median Filter (MF) So basically, it doesn't matter if we perform the Contrast Manipulation or Medical Filtering, as long as they are done sequencinally without any other operation in the middle, they result into the same output. This is because the square root operation doesn't affect the median of the matrix. We can see it as an increasing function which will have the same median regardless of the square root mapping. This is true for both pairs. For first pair, it doesn't matter if we do CF or MF first, SA will have the same input.

This will replace any high/low pixels with the median, which would techinally be part of the image and not a random number like SA would generate, making is blurred noise instead of removing the noise all together. Therefore, B and D would definally perform better becayse MF is being perform before SA. Similarly, A will also have better results than C, E, or F as SA is being performed before MF. We can confirm the above by looking at MSE of baby2 with clean image for each of the operations. Results are below.</p><pre class="codeinput">clc; clear; close <span class="string">all</span>;

% * Here, "map" represents the cummulative sum of the counts of each
% pixel (that are 0-255), given from the imhist. This will return the same
% matrix size as the input. Each entry is the cummulative sum of all the
% entries above. This means the last entry will be the total of the entire
% vector and the maximum value of the vector/1-D matrix. 
% * When we divide the map we get from cumsum with the max value in the
% map, we are basically normalizing the array to be between 0 to 1. This 
% allows for the plot to have x-axis going from 0 to 255, which are the
% pixel intensity and y-axis shown from 0 to 1 due to the normalization
% above and the plot has the increasing curve which represents the 
% CDF (cummulative distribution function) of the histogram of the gray img. 
% * With the imshow command the image being shown is showing the remapped 
% pixels using the remapping function that is CDF of the image. The map 
% input in imshow has an array of 3 map input because of the matlab 
% colormap convention that takes in one value input for each RGB values. So
% basically each row of map is a three-element RGB triplet that specifies 
% the red, green, and blue components of a single color of the colormap.

% * As it can be seen from the image, the dark background in the image 
% was hurting the histogram equalization. Thus if we just "ignore" those
% dark pixels aka the count of pixel 0 is 0, it will help a lot to see the
% smaller detailed in the image. This basically means we change our n
% variable's first entry to zero. So using the CDF of this n, we will be
% able to generate new map and plot the new image. 
% * As it can be seen from the equalized images, in the new image we are 
% able to see the details of the image clearly, which was not really
% visible due to the dark background from the first mapping. This can also
% be seen on the CDF plot, that we have zero pixels that are dark and this
% we just decreased the count of the darker pixels overall.

% * The 1x3 filter does better (in terms of MSE) than 3x3 filter for babyS.
% The median filter in general is good for removing salt and pepper noise. 
% Salt noise as we know it, is random white pixels (white dots in an image), 
% which in our case is distributed like vertical streaks in babyS. Here what 
% 1x3 median filter does is, it takes the 3 values in the neighborhood 
% (within that row) and sorts them, chooses the median and assigns it to 
% the pixel of interest. This forces pixels with distinct intensities to be
% more like it's neighbours. This 1x3 works better than 3x3, because, the 
% former sorts all 9 values (includes 3 rows), potentialy having more noise,
% since our noise is distributed vertically, making it more error prone
% than just looking at the row, which 1x3 does well. 
% * The 3x3 filter does better (in terms of MSE) than 1x3 filter for baby2.
% Notice that baby2 has added low level of Gaussian noise on top of the
% salt noise we saw in babyS. Thus even though 1x3 does better for babyS,
% it doesn't do that well for baby2 due to this added Gaussian noise. Here, 
% 3x3 filter helps because of the low level of Gaussian noise, it will look 
% at the entire neighbourhood and choose the median which will remove all 
% the low extream as well as high and actually chooses the value in the 
% sequence, rather than random number like mean filter could give, that
% might not even be part of the sequence.

%% 
% 
% * Here, the sequential use of a median filter and a spatial averaging
% filter on the baby2 image that has both noise type works better than
% either of the median filters in part a. However, it is not a significant 
% difference (just ~0.91 mse) from the lowest in part a.
% * We see that using the 1x3 is better than 3x3 median filter in this 
% sequence, it is because of the same reason as mentioned in part a. We
% have vertical salt noise and hence 1x3 is better. So with first operation
% in the series, we are decreasing that salt noise. Once we get rid of most
% of the salt noise, we can say that we are somewhat only left with the
% Gaussian noise. 
% * Now, because averaging works better with removing gaussian noise, we 
% have better results than just using 3x3 median filter alone for 
% the gaussian noise. Spatial average filter will replace each pixel with
% the average of it's all neighbours, this will help with the smoothing of
% the image.
% * One thing to note here is that, I tried varies spatial averaging
% filter, but the only one that actually recudes the error is the strong
% center weighted averaging filter, rather, the others don't give much
% different results that part a. This might be because we have the low
% frequency gaussian noise, and this the strong center helps with keeping
% the avg close to the pixel of interest and not skew towards the smaller
% outliers. 


%% Problem 3 Unsharp Masking  
%% _Part(a)_ 
clc; clear; close all;
type unsharp.m
%%
% *EXPLANATION* 
%%
%
% * Mask B can be seen as the original signal, which is basically a matrix
% of zeros with 1 on the center position 
% * Mask C is the difference of original signal and the input of mask A,
% which is the lowpass filter mask (LPF), which is basically highpass 
% filter mask (HPF). Because orignal signal is just the summation of HPF
% and LPF
% * Mask D is the unsharp mask, which is the HPF added to the orignal
% signal with some positive weight multiplied to it. 
% * This function performs edge sharpening by taking in the orignal image
% and lowpass filter image and finds the highpass filter mask to be added
% to the original image. By defination, the edge sharpened image is
% generated by adding the high frequency mask to the original image. What
% high frequency mask means the pixel values that changes quickly, and this
% happens on the edge of objects in an image. Thus, adding a weighted 
% highpass filter mask, just "bolds" the borders or the edges of the image.
% Hence, this function performs edge sharpening by just adding the high 
% frequency content to the input image.

% * First, looking at the images as we increase the weight for the highpass
% filter, we get a higher jump from bright to dark regions. This means that

% is again "bolding" the edge due to the HPF. The higher the weight the
% bolder it gets. This is true for all 3x3, 5x5, and 7x7 Lowpass filters. 
% * Now, let's look at what happens when we increase the filter size, the

% evident, but if we look closer, the images does seem little darker

% In this question we are using given Gaussian Lowpass filter to perform 
% high boost filtering. It is pretty much similar code as previous part.
% Here, I used different boost values ranging from 1 to around 30 and some
% of the results are shown above. What I noticed from the different boost
% values is that the original blurry moon image gets better as we increase
% the boost value, i.e, the blurryness decreases and the details are being
% visible. However, after certain threshold, the image starts to become too
% sharp for us to see much of the moon and it's just becomes some black and
% white image. The range that works best is of boostvalues between 8/10 to
% 20.

%% Problem 4 Order of Operations

%% _Part a_
%
% Out of the 6 systems given, 2 pairs will have the same results. 
% 
% # System B: CS REPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH> MF REPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH> SA and System D:  MF REPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH> CS REPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH> SA
% # System C: SA REPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH> CS REPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH> MF and System E:  SA REPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH> MF REPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH> CS
% 
% Here, Contrast Manipulation (CS), Spatial averaging (SA) and Median 
% Filter (MF) 
% So basically, it doesn't matter if we perform the Contrast Manipulation
% or Medical Filtering, as long as they are done sequencinally without any
% other operation in the middle, they result into the same output. This is
% because the square root operation doesn't affect the median of the 
% matrix. We can see it as an increasing function which will have the same
% median regardless of the square root mapping. This is true for both 
% pairs. For first pair, it doesn't matter if we do CF or MF first, SA will
% have the same input. Simiarly, for second pair, once we perform SA, we
% will not have to worry about the order of operation for MF or CS
%
% I used matlab to find the MSE and see how different each of the
% operations are. 
%
%% _Part b_
%
% As we have seen throughout this assignment and class lectures, Median 
% Filtering is really good at removing noises like salt-pepper, other 
% spikes or sudden changes, vertically distributed, or there are random 
% spurs. Therefore, it is really necessary to use MF before the SA, just 
% like Problem 3. This will replace any high/low pixels with the median,
% which would techinally be part of the image and not a random number like
% SA would generate, making is blurred noise instead of removing the noise
% all together. Therefore, B and D would definally perform better becayse
% MF is being perform before SA. Similarly, A will also have better results 
% than C, E, or F as SA is being performed before MF. 
% We can confirm the above by looking at MSE of baby2 with clean image for
% each of the operations. Results are below.
